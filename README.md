# Crypto Price Fetchers

A collection of scripts useful for fetching the price of various crypto tokens.

The need for this arises out of the proliferation of crypto tokens, such that most tracking services simply cannot fetch the price of many of the great tokens out there.

Note that for the files that are for Google Sheets, Google Sheets does not use the now-standard `fetch` API.  So, to convert these scripts to work under Web or NodeJS, you will need to use `fetch` with `async` and `await` as per normal for those platforms.
